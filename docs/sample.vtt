Hello this is Rajat Maheshwari 

2
00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:05.298
And I will be using this video as a tutorial 

3
00:00:05.904 --> 00:00:07.700
on how to use the Subplayer task 

4
00:00:07.756 --> 00:00:09.005
that had been assigned to me 

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.806
First things first I had prepared a Sample Video 

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.463
Which I will go through now 

7
00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:27.951
<Video Plays> 

8
00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.760
So as you can see the video already had English Captions 

9
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.956
that I had put in, so we'd have a basis 

10
00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:36.758
To Import this video 

11
00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:39.923
and according to my assigned task 

12
00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.492
I have to import this video using a Youtube URL 

13
00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:45.403
which I will proceed to do now 

14
00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:52.110
So as you can see, on the left hand side 

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.753
English Subtitles have been loaded in 

16
00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:55.388
On the right hand side as well 

17
00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:58.048
These English subtitles are for reference, these are not editable

18
00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.056
which was one of the bonus tasks that had been assigned 

19
00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.376
and these are completely editable sentences 

20
00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.721
So what you can do here is 

21
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:10.367
according to the react transliterate library 

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.328
the language that you have currently selected here 

23
00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:18.328
will the language the words here will be converted into 

24
00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:20.234
so let's select Hindi here 

25
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.496
And I'll just change a couple of sentences into Hindi, so for example

26
00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.536
this sentence will become 

27
00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:38.892
So as you can see, the sentences have been turned into Hindi

28
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.527
I'll also convert this sentence into Hindi, for example, this will become 

29
00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:55.309
So as you can see the sentences have been converted into the requested subtitles 

30
00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:58.771
The left hand side, as you can see is still in English 

31
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.642
And the right hand side is the transliterated subtitle in the language of your preference 

32
00:02:05.914 --> 00:02:08.793
So this was the task that I had implemented 

33
00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.672
I have also removed the advertisements from the right hand side 

34
00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.255
as had been requested 

35
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:19.338
and this video will be the tutorial video that will show up in place of the Japanese video along with the Subtitles
